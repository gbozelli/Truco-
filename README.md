Observation: the project is not concluded
# Truco!
Personally, I love card games. ItÂ´s easy to understand, and the rules are simple. You just need a deck and the fun turns on with yours friends. The game "Truco" is one of this fantastic games. So, I decided to make this game, but on Java (why not?). Initially, I thought to build in C++, but, as C++ a low-level language, the Java won on implementations (most part because the API).
## Objects as Card Managers
The most important thing that helped me a lot in this project is treat all things that used cards (like the players, the deck, the hand) like one thing: a manager of cards.
